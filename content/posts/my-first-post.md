I enjoy projects. Projects are my way of being creative and my outlet to fuel my
need to learn new things! But i have a problem... I tend to have a lot of
projects going on at the same time. Projects of all different sizes, from quick
projects that only take a couple hours to projects that are on going over years
(I guess those would be more often named hobbies?). See I love to learn things,
all kinds of things, and my projects tend to be how I learn things.

Lately my projects tend to fit into a couple different categories: Woodworking,
Electronics and Programming. I'm a software developer for my work so I enjoy
playing with new things related to my work (software, devops, opensource, etc)
but I also enjoy doing things entirely unrelated. Its nice to work with my hands
for a change and built things with wood like furniture.

This blog is hopefully going to be where I write about the projects I do, the
problems I run into and the solutions I find. Thanks for coming, I hope you
learn something here.
